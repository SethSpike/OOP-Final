Slime Jumper
How to play:

The game is a platformer which means you have to move up the platforms and climb as high as you can much like the famous game Doodle Jump and Jump Knight. 
The character in the game is a slime. 
Click on the slime and drag it towards the platforms to keep going higher. 
Once you get to the top you will be teleported into a new level. 
Continue to climb up the platforms until the end. Little click and drags move the slime a little where large clicks and drags move the slime a lot. 
You may have to move the slime slightly to the edge of a platform to jump to the next. 
If you fall off a platform you must restart and climb back to the top. 
Rememeber you cant jump twice and doing so will lock you down.
This game was coded entirely in C# using the software Unity and Visual Studio.
